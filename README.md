This project is a rough programmed prototype for Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, demonstrating the potential of an internal tool to help implementation consultants in the communication of configuration decisions for electronic health records (EHRs).

## Technology
- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Redux-Thunk
- styled-components

## Datastore
(Airtable)[www.airtable.com] is a database that operates like a spreadsheet but exposes a REST API for most operations. This was used to build the schema/model of an EHR implementation and connect it with key individuals involved.


## Live Demo

The live demo can be found at www.allscripts-chorus.herokuapp.com.

## Backlog

- The custom CSS needs refactoring and work to cater to the needs of the design.
- Create an actual MySQL / PostgreSQL database and wrap Apollo GraphQL around it.
